# Papollo Hospitals - Leads Flow Dashboard

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Leads Flow Dashboard** created for Papollo Hospitals. This dashboard is designed to provide insights into patient management, billing, and occupancy within the hospital. It helps administrators and healthcare professionals visualize key metrics such as bed occupancy, feedback volumes per doctor, and diagnosis-wise patient counts.

## Project Overview

The Leads Flow Dashboard displays critical information to support hospital management in tracking patient flow, billing, and service demand. The key sections of the dashboard include:
- **Admit, Discharge, and Follow-up Dates:** Displays essential patient dates for tracking hospital visits.
- **Bill Amount:** Shows the total billing amount for each patient.
- **Bed Occupancy:** Highlights the number of patients in Private, General, and ICU wards.
- **Feedback Volume per Doctor:** Displays feedback volume per doctor, enabling monitoring of doctor engagement.
- **Diagnosis-wise Patient Count:** Lists patient counts based on diagnoses like Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, etc.
- **Health Insurance and Billing Amounts:** Graphs health insurance and billing amounts across services like CT Scan, MRI, Blood Tests, and X-rays.

## Features

1. **Date and Patient Filtering:** Filters data based on selected date ranges and Patient ID.
2. **Bed Occupancy Visualization:** Shows a bar chart to track the occupancy of private, general, and ICU beds.
3. **Feedback Volume per Doctor:** A donut chart to display feedback volume per doctor.
4. **Diagnosis-wise Patient Count:** A horizontal bar chart showing the count of patients with specific diagnoses.
5. **Health Insurance and Billing Analysis:** Line chart comparing billing amounts and health insurance amounts across different tests (CT Scan, Ultrasound, MRI, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for backend data processing.
- **Power BI / Tableau** for data visualization (if used).
- **SQL** for data extraction and transformation (if applicable).
- **HTML/CSS** (if a web-based dashboard).
- **Git/GitHub** for version control.
